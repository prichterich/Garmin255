Data are from a windsurfing session in small chop. The Garmin 255 data were recorded using "SUP" as the activity. 
Comparison data are from 2 boom-mounted ESP loggers with u-blox GPS chips.
The Garmin data show heavy filtering, lower top speeds, and a delay of 6-10 seconds to the ESP speeds that seems to be the result of the heavy filtering.
